# INFR3120 Fall25 Project - Task Tracker

**Team Members:**

## Project Idea
We are building a Task Tracker web application. The site will let users create, view, update, and delete tasks. It will help people organize and manage their work easily.  

The home page shows all tasks in a table. Users can add new tasks using a button. Tasks can also be edited or deleted from the table.  

This is our first release, so the site is functional but not fully styled yet.  

## Features
- Landing/Home Page with Team Name and Logo  
- Add new tasks (Create)  
- View all tasks (Read)  
- Edit tasks (Update)  
- Delete tasks (Delete)  
- Fully functional CRUD operations  
- No login required yet
